# audio-frequency-spectrum-analyser
Read audio from file or sound card input and display waveform and FFT

Based on a tutorial by Youtube user Mark Jay. Credit goes to him for the original code.

I made some modifications, bundled it up into a class and added the ability to take in any audio file that your operating system is capable of playing. I stuck with using matplotlib instead of PyQTGraph just to keeps things a little simpler and so that everything needed is installable with pip.

## requirements
All code is written for Python3
modules not in the python standard library are: pyaudio, matplotlib, numpy, scipy and audioread

`pip install pyaudio`

if you are on linux you will also need to install the portaudiov19-dev package with your package manager

I have heard that on windows you also need to pip install pywin, however this is untested

`pip install matplotlib`
`pip install numpy`
`pip install scipy`
`pip install audioread`

if running this module as the main file in your project there is some example code at the bottom to help get you started.

you can pass 'create_plot=False' when instancing the class to stop automatic plot generation, although thats pretty boring

# visualizer.py
This class can take data generated by the AudioObject class above to create a visualization. Just like above, you can run this as your main project file as their is some example code at the bottom. I plan on adding different styles of visualization at a later point.
